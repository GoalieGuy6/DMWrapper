# If you want to use special characters in this document, such as accented letters, you MUST save the file as UTF-8, not ANSI.
# If you receive an error when Essentials loads, ensure that:
#   - No tabs are present: YAML only allows spaces
#   - Indents are correct: YAML heirarchy is based entirely on indentation
#   - You have "escaped" all apostrophes in your text: If you want to write "don't", for example, write "don''t" instead (note the doubled apostrphe)
#   - List items are prefixed with a hyphen and indented:
#       lists:
#         - look like this
#       not:
#       - like this
#   - Text with symbols is enclosed in single or double quotation marks
#   - CraftBukkit and Permissions have been updated: CraftBukkit and Essentials almost always line up, but sometimes other plugins fall behind CraftBukkit's multiple daily updates
#   - You have saved the document as UTF-8, NOT the default, ANSI
